# CarGame
# Your car goes on a vertical road moving towards the upper half of the screen. The road will have three lanes and each lane will have different obstacles that you will have to avoid, weather it be other cars going the same way as you, a bush, cones, or an animal. You will use the left and right arrow to move the car to and from different lanes. There will be a time tracker calculating how long you lasted in the game and will be your final score. If you hit one of the obstacles the game will end and the end screen will display your score, and you can start over if you want in attempt to beat your high score.
